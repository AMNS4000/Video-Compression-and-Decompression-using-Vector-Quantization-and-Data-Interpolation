1.)Video Compression and Decompression through Vector Quantization

2.)Used LBG (Linde-Buzo-Grey) Algorithm for compression

3.)Conversion from RGB to YCbCr scale for better decompression

4.)Achieved an SNR of 12 and Compression factor of 0.7

5.) Took a 10 min video clip of Avengers Endgame and the result is stored as final_video
