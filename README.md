1.)Video Compression and Decompression through Vector Quantization
2.)Used LBG (Linde-Buzo-Grey) Algorithm for compression
3.)Conversion from RGB to YCbCr scale for better decompression
4.)Achieved an SNR of 12 and Compression factor of 0.7
5.) Took a 10 min video clip of Avengers Endgame and the result is stored as final_video
